/**
 * ResearcherAgent — multi-agent handoff worked example
 *
 * The agents-as-tools pattern from the OpenAI Agents SDK / Mastra /
 * Anthropic Claude Agent SDK convergence. The LLM decides when to
 * hand off by calling a tool whose execution invokes another agent.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   1. User asks: "Research and write up X"
 *   2. ResearcherAgent's LLM calls `web_search` to gather info
 *   3. When it has enough material, the LLM calls
 *      `delegate_to_writer` with notes + brief
 *   4. The tool fetches the WriterAgent stub and calls runOnce
 *   5. Writer composes the polished response
 *   6. Researcher returns the writer's text as its final answer
 *
 * Why this pattern over a single bigger agent?
 *   - **Separation of concerns** — research strategy and prose
 *     composition are different skills. Different prompts, models,
 *     temperatures.
 *   - **Cost** — research can run on a flagship model with grounding
 *     tools; writing on a cheaper model. Each agent picks its own.
 *   - **Reuse** — multiple specialist agents can all hand off to the
 *     same Writer.
 *   - **Tracing** — each agent's tool calls and token usage are
 *     attributed separately in the SDK's observability events.
 *
 * Partition: `${userId}:${slug}` — same convention as AssistantAgent.
 * Each research topic can have its own researcher instance (so the
 * conversation history is scoped to that topic).

1. Use \`web_search\` to gather concrete facts on the user's topic. Run multiple searches with different angles when one query isn't enough.
2. When you have enough material to answer well, call \`delegate_to_writer\` with:
   - \`notes\`: the relevant facts you gathered (URLs + 1-line summaries)
   - \`brief\`: what the user actually asked for, in your words

The writer composes the final response. After you call delegate_to_writer, return the writer's response verbatim — don't restate or summarise it.

If the topic is too narrow / personal / opinion-based for web search, skip search and call delegate_to_writer with a brief explaining what's needed.`
