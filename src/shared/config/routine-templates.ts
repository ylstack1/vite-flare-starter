 *     user reviews + saves)
 *   - The legacy `POST /api/routines/seed-examples` bulk-create
 *     endpoint (one click → all templates land disabled)
 *
 * A template is everything you'd type into NewRoutinePage. The agent
 * name slug is derived per-user; we expose `agentNameSlug` instead of
 * a literal `agentName` so the server can stamp the user id onto it.
 *
 * Add new templates here — both surfaces pick them up automatically.
