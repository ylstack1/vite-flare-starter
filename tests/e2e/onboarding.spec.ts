/**
 * Onboarding killer-flow tests — covers P1-006.
 *
 * P1-006: "Schedule a routine" appears on the Getting Started checklist.
 *
 * The checklist hides itself once all 6 steps are complete OR the user
 * has dismissed it. To be deterministic, we reset the dismissed flag +
 * lift the checklist out of the "all done" state via the prefs API
 * before asserting. The "routine" step ticks based on count(*) > 0
 * on the routines table, so we don't try to assert that here — we just
 * verify the static label is present in the DOM.
