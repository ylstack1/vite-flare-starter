 * Skills killer-flow tests — covers P4-002.
 *
 * P4-002: editing a skill in the source editor while the buffer is
 * dirty should arm the browser's "leave site?" prompt via beforeunload.
 *
 * We can't drive the native confirm dialog from Playwright (it's a
 * system-level UI on close-tab / hard-reload), but we CAN verify that
 * the page registered a beforeunload handler that returns a non-empty
 * value while the buffer is dirty — which is exactly what triggers
 * the prompt in real browsers.
